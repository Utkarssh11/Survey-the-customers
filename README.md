# Survey-the-customers


Required Assessment for SDE Intern (Frontend) > Use only HTML

You need to build a frontend application to survey the customers in a shop. We set these questions in a Kiosk inside the shop. We have 5 questions that need to be asked to every customer in the shop. Questions are,

How satisfied are you with our products? (Rating type, 1-5)
How fair are the prices compared to similar retailers? (Rating type, 1-5)
How satisfied are you with the value for money of your purchase? (Rating Type, 1-5)
On a scale of 1-10 how would you recommend us to your friends and family? (Rating Type, 1-10)
What could we do to improve our service? (Text Type)
