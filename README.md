# Survey-the-customers


Required Assessment for SDE Intern (Frontend) > Use only HTML

You need to build a frontend application to survey the customers in a shop. We set these questions in a Kiosk inside the shop. We have 5 questions that need to be asked to every customer in the shop. Questions are,

How satisfied are you with our products? (Rating type, 1-5)
How fair are the prices compared to similar retailers? (Rating type, 1-5)
How satisfied are you with the value for money of your purchase? (Rating Type, 1-5)
On a scale of 1-10 how would you recommend us to your friends and family? (Rating Type, 1-10)
What could we do to improve our service? (Text Type)

The HTML code defines the structure and content of the customer survey application. It includes an <h1> heading for the survey title, <div> containers for different sections (welcome, questions, thank-you), and appropriate HTML elements for displaying the questions and capturing customer responses. The HTML code serves as the foundation for the survey application, and additional functionality and styling can be added using CSS and JavaScript.
